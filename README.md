Twitter Clone
This project is just the clone of homepage of Twitter.

Tehnologies used :- Reactjs,Html,Css,Js

Others :- Github Icons for using Icons and Logos.
Github Pages for hosting this project.
     
Approach :- First I created three different sections as right sidebar,main and left sidebar.The left sidebar includes all the links for ome,messages,profiles,etc. The main page is the place for tweets.Here you can upload tweets and see other tweets as well.Lastly the right sidebar includes all the trending news or tweets like Breakingnews,etc. Also you get a search bar where you can search for different accounts and tweets.
